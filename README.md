The simplest way to clean out your backpack.

Just barely getting started with this process. Be patient.

Work in progress. Hope to release without bugs by September 2018, at the latest.

Puts your items away into chests that have an item of the same name. If there are duplicates, it will keep them in your backpack, and show you in what chests the duplicates are, so you can re-organize without havin to remember where the item may be. This is especially important the farther you progress in the game, and you have many more chests than in the beginning. It will also keep items that are in no chest, which highlights new items that you havn't encountered before.

I wanted to create a Mod for Stardew Valley to clear your backpack to reduce the time it takes to put away your bounty.
Starting with only 12-Slots in your backpack, foraging is awkward at best. Many Mods can help with this, but nothing was quite what I wanted.

1) Make it the simplist to use. Fewest number of simple, interactions possible. (expand)
2) Some control over restrictions, to make it easier or harder. Limited options balancing difficulty and enjoyment.
3) Access to options in-game. No need to edit a text file, but the option is still there for those who prefer it.
4) Try to avoid code that tends to break with Game and SMAPI updates.

Works well with StackEverything, ChestsAntwhere, Automate.
